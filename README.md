Currently working on [my minecraft server installer](https://github.com/Lordva/minecraft-server-installer) and the [Download Manager for Linux](https://github.com/Lordva/Download_manager)

My goal is to make one commit a day for the rest of 2020 !
I'm specialized in Bash scripts (because it's easy and fit qute well with the crap I'm doing) and I'm trying to learn JS w/ react

I'm also a Linux Sysadmin.
